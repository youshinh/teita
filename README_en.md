# Teita - A Web App to Experience the "Seri Culture" of Kyoto Central Wholesale Market

## Background of Development

We developed the "Teita" web application with the aim of **re-recognizing the value of the unique "Seri culture" of the Kyoto Central Wholesale Market and conveying it to many people**. This app allows users to experience the profound depth of the market, which goes beyond mere transaction efficiency, through a game. Below is the background that led to its development.

### 1. History and Culture of Kyoto Central Wholesale Market

The Kyoto Central Wholesale Market, established in 1927, is one of the first central wholesale markets in Japan, and **its unique culture and customs have been passed down for nearly 100 years**. Compared to other markets, it is characterized by a higher proportion of "Seri (auction) transactions," retaining a strong traditional trading style. Here, not only are goods bought and sold, but there is also a human touch where **interpersonal relationships and trust significantly influence price determination and transactions**. The market plays a crucial role in nurturing and supporting Kyoto's food culture, and at its heart lies the "Seri" culture.

### 2. Modern Challenges Faced by the Market

However, this traditional market also faces many challenges with changes in modern society. Over the past decade, the volume of fish handled has decreased by 51%, putting it at risk of decline. This is due to a complex interplay of factors such as declining consumption due to a declining birthrate and aging population, changes in dietary habits (increase in ready-made meals and dining out), larger production areas and diversification of distribution channels, a decrease in retail stores, and traditional systems becoming unsuitable for modern times. Furthermore, the unique culture of the people working in the market, due to a lack of communication with the general public and surrounding businesses, has created a **closed atmosphere**, and its charm is not fully conveyed, leading to a "disconnection from the local community." The "succession problem," where young talent finds it difficult to enter the market, is also becoming serious.

### 3. "Financial Value" and "Semantic Value"

In response to these challenges, we believe it is necessary to emphasize **"semantic value" – what meaning the culture holds – rather than merely pursuing "financial value"** (efficiency and profitability) based on "how much profit can be made." In a globalized and capitalist society where efficiency and standardization are advancing, we concluded that protecting the unique culture and identity of a place is ultimately the source of the market's competitiveness. This is based on the idea that "human relationships" that cannot be replaced by AI or digital technology become valuable, and that pursuing "semantic value" – discovering happiness in interpersonal relationships, not just material wealth – is important.

### 4. The Depth of "Seri Culture" and "B-side Culture"

The "Seri culture" of the market possesses a unique "B-side culture" that cannot be measured solely by efficiency or rationality. For example, in Seri, a distinctive method of bidding is used where numbers are written on a small blackboard called "Teita." This not only indicates the price but also functions as a **symbol that mediates unspoken negotiations, human relationships, and tacit knowledge**. Furthermore, there are "lending and borrowing" among traders and informal bidding rules, which are built on years of trust. These seemingly inefficient forms are believed to constitute the "social capital" that supports the market's sustainability and the competitiveness of its food culture.

## Global Goals Jam 2025 Kyoto

**About Global Goals Jam:**
The "Teita" app embodies an idea born from "Global Goals Jam 2025 Kyoto," an international participatory workshop aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2025, the event was held in the "Umekoji" area, a unique blend of Kyoto's first central wholesale market and emerging creative hubs.

### Key Features

*   **Digital Teita (Hand Board)**: As a digital tool inspired by the "Teita" (hand board) used in actual Seri, it allows users to manipulate and display numbers on a touch panel.
*   **Number Input and Display**: Users input single or double-digit numbers via a keypad, which are then prominently displayed on the screen.
*   **Emphasis Animation**: A periodic enlarge/shrink animation is applied to the displayed numbers, adding visual emphasis to the number presentation. The intensity of this emphasis is configurable.
*   **Screen Transition via Shake Detection**: Shaking the device allows users to return from the display screen to the input screen. This functions as a trigger to "cancel" the presented number or "proceed to the next action."
*   **Gesture Detection and Result/Unit Association**: Specific swipe gestures (left/right, up/down) and two-finger touches allow users to return to the input screen from the display screen. At this time, pre-configured "results" (e.g., "Successful Bid," "No Bid," "Hold," "Invalid") and "units" (e.g., "Kg," "Case") can be associated and recorded. This can be used to express outcomes like "successful bid," "no bid," or "hold" in Seri, as well as the confirmation of quantities and units.
*   **Logging Function**: Displays numbers, subsequent actions (screen transition methods via shake or gesture), associated results, units, and free-form notes with timestamps in a list. This log can be exported in TSV format, allowing for tracking and managing the history of "negotiations."

### Our Vision

In this game, we aim to focus not just on individuals pursuing profit, but on **forming trusting relationships where everyone can benefit by cooperating** (currently under consideration). Through this, we aim to convey to the general public the core culture of the market: that it is not merely a place for exchanging goods, but **a place for exchanging human relationships and social capital**.

We hope that through "Teita," participants will naturally learn the "semantic value" that the market has cherished – the importance of human relationships and the spirit of cooperation – and gain an opportunity to experience the profound depth of Seri culture.
